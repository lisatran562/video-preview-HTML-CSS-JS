# Coding Dojo Assignment video-preview-HTML-CSS-JS

## Video Preview
Objectives
- Practice using onmouseover and onmouseout
- Practice working from an existing code base

For this assignment we'll be working with some existing code (download here) to add a video in. We'll want to find a free video that we want to work with from https://www.pexels.com/videos/.  Next we'll want to add the video into a video tag in the HTML. To make the website more interactive add hover events to play and pause the video when hovering.
